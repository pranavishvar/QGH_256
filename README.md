# QGH_256
QGH_256 is a graph-based quantum hash function using classical random walks and Quantum Phase Estimation. It builds a weighted graph from the input message, extracts its spectral fingerprint via QPE, and this spectral fingerprint serves as the hash. Developed as part of QPoland Global Quantum Hackathon (Open Track).
